<h1>My favorite hobby is riding my E-bike</h1>
<!-- I used an h1 element to show what my favorite hobby is-->
<p>I currently have two e-bikes, but my favorite bike is my Sondors fold X.</p>
<p>Whenever I'm not at work I really like being outside and riding my bike.</p>
<p>My favorite time of the year is the fall, becuase the weather and sceneary are just beautiful.</p>
<!--I used a p element to incorporate a paragraph about my favorite hobby-->
